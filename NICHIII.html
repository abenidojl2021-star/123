<h1 style="color:white;"><i>Nichi—</i></h1>
<p style="color:white;">My Sun, My Day</p>

<p style="color:white;">You're such a wonderful existence I only dreamt of.<br>
The way you smile, the way you laugh,<br>
And the brilliance in those eyes that pierce through me.<br>
I can't help but wonder, how can this person be real?<br>
Strong, yet delicate.<br>
Gentle, kind, and knows her worth.<br>
Logical, sensitive, and compassionate.<br>
Smart and talented.<br>
Witty and humorous.<br>
Broken and molded through the hardships and experiences of life.<br>
A living embodiment of a superwoman.</p>

<p style="color:white;"><b>My Nichi—</b></p>
<p style="color:white;">You are the sun that brings light to my day.<br>
The laughter that brings joy to my heart.<br>
The smile that I will always admire.<br>
I will be forever grateful that I had the chance to meet you and experience how amazing of a person you are.<br>
I will always cherish the times we were together, talking about anything, like it all made sense.<br>
You made me realize how wonderful this world can be.<br>
And how far it can be more wonderful being with you.<br></p>
<p style="color:white;">I love you, and I mean it.</p>
<p style="color:white;">A love so wonderful, it made me imagine a future with you.</p>
<p style="color:white;">A love that may transcend time.</p>
<p style="color:white;">A love so short, yet feels real and right.</p>
<p style="color:white;">I love you, from the very bottom of my heart.</p>
<p style="color:white;">My Nichi. My sun. My day.</p>
